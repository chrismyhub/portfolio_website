    <p id="abouttext">Aspiring Web Developer, currently undertaking a Diploma of Information Technology with Coder Academy and aim to complete my studies in July 2022.  I have always found myself using code in one way or another over my working career.  Whether it be using formula’s in Microsoft Excel to help save time whilst maintaining accuracy or using a system of code to locate a record in a repository or organise a project using a Work Breakdown Structure.  Of course nothing as complex as HTML, CSS or Ruby.  Which is what drew me to Coder Academy, to get to the roots of coding, its language.  To learn and use it to build more complex things.
        <br>
        <br>
        Born but not bred in Australia.  I’ve spent a lot of time growing up overseas in various countries, which exposed me to different cultures and gave me a better appreciation for life in general.  I came back to Australia to complete my University studies in 2004.  After which I started my working career in the field of Project Planning and Scheduling.
        <br>
        <br>
        In my down time (if there is any when you have kids), I enjoy the occasional movie or tv series, but I enjoy solving/fixing things most.  This includes things like jig saw/word puzzles, an Excel problem or a home renovation issue.  I find satisfaction in providing a solution to a problem.
